<strong># DETAILS </strong>

Date ........................................................... Jan 16-18, 2026
Location ............................................ (TBA, waiting confirmation)


Summer is still far away, but we’re too restless to sit still. The soldering
irons are calling, the code is itching to compile, and the coffee won’t brew
itself. It’s time to gather the No Trolls Allowed community once more - to
build, make, knit, solder, code, brew, hack, chat, and share some winter warmth
together. Why wait for the summer camp when we can bring the spark earlier? This
is the first multi-day winter meetup for the NTA community. To keep the spirit
of the main hackercamp intact, the event follows a more relaxed format: fewer
talks, more doing. No packed schedule, no rush-just time and space to finish
that half-built gadget, test a wild idea, play a board game, or watch and
discuss conference talks together. Bring your unfinished projects, your favorite
soldering iron, your best debugging stories, and that one weird link you just
have to show everyone. We’ve got the whole weekend. Let’s make it count.

## Schedule

* Friday - We (not trolls) arrive in the evening, settle in, and connect to the
  local (human) network.
* Saturday - A full day (and probably night) of hacking, tinkering, and general
  creative chaos.
* Sunday - Cleanup, packing and the traditional suffering.

<strong># ACTIVITIES </strong>

## Open-Mic Corner

> Space dedicated to presentations, trivia, and ad-hoc talks. It is encouraged
> to talk about unfinished projects, ideas or other things you'd like to share.
> The format is more relaxed compared to the summer event - there won't be tight
> time slots, ad-hoc talks are alowed. But if you already have a topic - post a
> comment to the dedicated corner's PR. There will be a projector available. We
> will find a laptop if needed.

## Makers Corner

> Have an unfinished project and can not find time for it anymore? Always wanted
> to build something but struggled to find a better approach? Bring your 3D
> printer, soldering iron and electronics here and spend time working on your
> project! Or run a workshop for other participants. There will be dedicated
> desks and electricity available.

## Conferences Videos Corner

>

## Board games Corner

> Want to spend full two days playing your favorite board game? Bring it here
> - we have time and place!

## Donors Corner

> We need to collect 1000€ for this event. Hopefully we won't need more after
> the event. All donors will be listed here for for visibility and fame.
